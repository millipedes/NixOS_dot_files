This is the collection of files that I use to make my NixOS machine what it is.
These are the dot files for several Programs on my system (to include the system
configuration itself).

Some of the files in this collection have been used from the EndevourOS system.
They are all of the files that are under the i3 scripts (additionally, I
partially based my i3 config and i3blocks config off of their default
configuration file).
