# :star2: My Dot Files
This is the collection of files that I use to make my NixOS machine what it is.
These are the dot files for several Programs on my system (to include the system
configuration itself).


## Some Credits
Some of the files in this collection have been used from the EndevourOS system.
They are all of the files that are under the `i3/scripts/` directory
(I partially based my i3 config and i3blocks config off of their default
connfiguration file also).  Also the whole rofi config.

Additionally, large sections of my neovim configuration are based off the code
presented in the set of videos made by chris@machine's YouTube Video series
"Neovim IDE from Scratch".

I generally get my photos from [this](https://unsplash.com/s/photos/natural)
